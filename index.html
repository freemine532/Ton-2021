    </h2>

	Hello let's me to summarize our ideas into 2 minutes.
The our idea is a new version of Human readable address.
As u know human readable address is a ton address shortener and it's a domain too.
Why we shouldn't use the a conventional domain wich is supported by all of the browsers at this time ?
At the first time bit.ly did that with long urls and they were successful.
Now we have a wallet address need to be short.
So we will give a domain like user1.Ton.Com to every users who want it instead of user1.Ton

In this way we are publishing the main website url through the all social medias does users using and it's making back links to our main website.( Why bit.ly is famous ?)

This all of the idea.
We maked a chrome extension for that but because of low time didn't completed yet âœ…</p>
    <p>
        The main idea is to create a Chrome extension wallet which is supporting our human-readable address.
        <br>It's working like Metamask but with an especial feature.
        <br>This wallet will inject a javascript code to the webpage and will highlight all the human-readable address.
    </p>

    <p>
        what is human-readable address ?<br>
        Human readable addresses - or HRAs - replace the long, complex strings of characters used by most blockchains to identify individuals and their receiving addresses. Human readable addresses make it easy to share wallet addresses and your crypto-identity in everyday conversation. HRAs use a simple @name designation, and therefore are easy to remember in everyday conversation.
        <br>
        Near & fantom Coin using a system like that. (user1.Near, user1.FTM)
        <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        <p>
        But FTM and Near coins are strongly wrong. their human-readable domains are just useless words.<br>
        we are trying to use a useful domain (user1.Ton.com) instead of user1.Near.
        <br>
        when a users use our HRAs in their social media will make a backlink to our website.<br>
        this feature will affect on the main website Seo
        (in this case Ton.com) and will increase the ranking of the website.<br>
        every users who using HRAs is our advertiser throughout WorldWideWeb.
        </p>
        Human-readable addresses consist of two parts:
        <br>1. Domain Name:<br>
        a conventional domain name which is host website on it.
        <br>2. Subdomains :<br>
        we will give this subdomain to every user who interested in. this subdomain is unique and attached to a Ton wallet address.
        <br><br>Example: user1.Ton.com
        <br>Lets to see examples.
